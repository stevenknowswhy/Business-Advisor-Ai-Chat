# Architecture Decision Log

## 📋 Decision Record

### AD-001: Stripe Integration Pattern
**Date**: 2025-09-19
**Status**: Accepted
**Context**: Need to integrate payment processing for advisor subscriptions

**Decision**: Use Stripe Elements with payment intents approach
- Client-side: `@stripe/react-stripe-js` for secure payment form
- Server-side: Stripe Node.js SDK for payment processing
- Webhooks: Handle asynchronous events (payment.success, payment.failed)

**Alternatives Considered**:
1. Stripe Checkout (redirect-based) - Less flexible for our use case
2. Third-party payment providers - Would require additional integration work

**Consequences**:
- ✅ Secure payment processing with PCI compliance
- ✅ Customizable payment flow within our app
- ✅ Support for multiple payment methods
- ⚠️ Requires proper webhook handling for async events

### AD-002: RBAC Implementation Strategy
**Date**: 2025-09-19
**Status**: Accepted
**Context**: Need role-based access control for different user types

**Decision**: Implement RBAC using Clerk roles and Convex functions
- Clerk: Authentication and role management
- Convex: Data access control at the function level
- Custom middleware: Role-based route protection

**Role Hierarchy**:
1. **User**: Basic access, can browse advisors
2. **Subscriber**: Paid access, can chat with advisors
3. **Advisor**: Can create profile and receive messages
4. **Admin**: Full system access

**Alternatives Considered**:
1. Custom RBAC implementation - Would require more maintenance
2. Third-party RBAC services - Additional cost and complexity

**Consequences**:
- ✅ Leverages existing Clerk authentication
- ✅ Fine-grained access control at data level
- ✅ Scalable role management
- ⚠️ Requires careful testing of role permissions

### AD-003: CMS Integration Approach
**Date**: 2025-09-19
**Status**: Accepted
**Context**: Need to integrate blog content from marketing site

**Decision**: API-based integration with caching
- Marketing site provides blog API endpoint
- Main app fetches and caches blog content
- Client-side components display blog previews

**Alternatives Considered**:
1. Shared database - Would complicate deployment
2. Static content generation - Less flexible for dynamic content
3. Third-party headless CMS - Additional cost and complexity

**Consequences**:
- ✅ Decoupled architecture
- ✅ Independent deployment of both sites
- ✅ Caching improves performance
- ⚠️ Requires API monitoring and fallback handling

### AD-004: Component Architecture for Payments
**Date**: 2025-09-19
**Status**: Accepted
**Context**: Need reusable payment components across the application

**Decision**: Atomic design pattern with payment-specific components
- PaymentModal: Main payment interface
- PaymentStatus: Success/error handling
- SubscriptionCard: Pricing display
- PaymentDashboard: User management

**Component Hierarchy**:
```
PaymentModal
├── PaymentForm
├── BillingDetails
├── OrderSummary
└── PaymentMethodSelector

PaymentDashboard
├── SubscriptionStatus
├── PaymentHistory
├── BillingInformation
└── InvoiceList
```

**Alternatives Considered**:
1. Monolithic payment component - Less reusable
2. Third-party payment UI - Limited customization

**Consequences**:
- ✅ Reusable components across features
- ✅ Consistent payment experience
- ✅ Easier testing and maintenance
- ⚠️ Requires careful state management

### AD-005: API Design Patterns
**Date**: 2025-09-19
**Status**: Accepted
**Context**: Need consistent API design for new features

**Decision**: RESTful API with Next.js App Router
- Standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
- JSON response format
- Consistent error handling
- Authentication middleware

**API Structure**:
```
/api/payments/
├── POST /create-intent
├── POST /confirm
├── GET /status/[id]
└── POST /webhook

/api/subscriptions/
├── POST /create
├── PUT /cancel
├── GET /user/[userId]
└── PUT /update

/api/roles/
├── POST /assign
├── DELETE /remove
├── GET /user/[userId]
└── GET /list
```

**Alternatives Considered**:
1. GraphQL - Overkill for our current needs
2. tRPC - Would require additional learning curve

**Consequences**:
- ✅ Simple and familiar API pattern
- ✅ Easy to test and debug
- ✅ Good performance with Next.js caching
- ⚠️ Requires consistent documentation

### AD-006: State Management Strategy
**Date**: 2025-09-19
**Status**: Accepted
**Context**: Need to manage complex state for payments and subscriptions

**Decision**: React Query + local state management
- React Query: Server state and caching
- Local state: Form state and UI state
- Context: Global user and subscription state

**State Management Layers**:
1. **Server State** (React Query): Payments, subscriptions, user data
2. **Global State** (Context): User authentication, subscription status
3. **Local State** (useState): Form inputs, UI state, loading states

**Alternatives Considered**:
1. Redux: Overkill for our current complexity
2. Zustand: Would add another dependency

**Consequences**:
- ✅ Leverages existing React patterns
- ✅ Automatic caching and background updates
- ✅ Simple to implement and maintain
- ⚠️ Requires careful cache invalidation

### AD-007: Error Handling Strategy
**Date**: 2025-09-19
**Status**: Accepted
**Context**: Need consistent error handling across payment flows

**Decision**: Hierarchical error handling with user-friendly messages
- API errors: Standardized error response format
- Component errors: Error boundaries and fallback UI
- Payment errors: Specific error messages for payment failures

**Error Types**:
1. **Network Errors**: Retry mechanism with exponential backoff
2. **Validation Errors**: Real-time form validation
3. **Payment Errors**: Clear user guidance for resolution
4. **Permission Errors**: Redirect to appropriate pages

**Alternatives Considered**:
1. Global error handler only - Less granular
2. Third-party error monitoring - Additional cost

**Consequences**:
- ✅ Comprehensive error coverage
- ✅ Better user experience with clear error messages
- ✅ Easier debugging and monitoring
- ⚠️ Requires careful error message crafting

### AD-008: Testing Strategy
**Date**: 2025-09-19
**Status**: Accepted
**Context**: Need to ensure reliability of payment processing

**Decision**: Multi-layer testing approach
- Unit tests: Individual component and utility functions
- Integration tests: API endpoints and database operations
- E2E tests: Complete payment flows with Stripe test mode

**Testing Pyramid**:
1. **Unit Tests (70%)**: Component logic, utilities, validation
2. **Integration Tests (20%)**: API routes, database operations
3. **E2E Tests (10%)**: Complete payment flows

**Testing Tools**:
- Jest: Unit and integration tests
- React Testing Library: Component testing
- Stripe test environment: Payment flow testing

**Alternatives Considered**:
1. Manual testing only - High risk of bugs
2. Third-party testing services - Additional cost

**Consequences**:
- ✅ High test coverage for critical payment flows
- ✅ Automated testing catches regressions
- ✅ Confidence in payment processing reliability
- ⚠️ Requires ongoing test maintenance
