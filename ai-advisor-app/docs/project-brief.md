# AI Advisor Chat - Project Brief

## Executive Summary

**Project Name:** AI Advisor Chat
**Project Type:** Full-Stack SaaS Web Application
**Development Approach:** Greenfield Development using T3 Stack + BMAD Method
**Target Deployment:** Vercel with Neon PostgreSQL

## Vision Statement

Create a Teams-like AI advisory board application that enables users to have natural conversations with multiple specialized AI advisors, each with distinct personas, expertise areas, and communication styles. The platform will provide intelligent advisor switching, conversation persistence, and tiered model access based on user subscription plans.

## Problem Statement

### Current Pain Points
1. **Fragmented AI Interactions**: Users must switch between different AI tools for different types of advice
2. **Lack of Specialized Expertise**: Generic AI assistants don't provide domain-specific insights
3. **No Conversation Continuity**: Most AI tools don't maintain context across sessions
4. **Limited Collaboration**: No way to have multiple AI experts collaborate on complex problems

### Market Opportunity
- Growing demand for specialized AI advisory services
- Enterprise need for AI-powered decision support systems
- Opportunity to create a "virtual board of advisors" experience
- Potential for subscription-based AI expertise platform

## Solution Overview

### Core Concept
A chat-based platform where users can interact with a curated set of AI advisors, each with:
- **Distinct Personas**: Unique backgrounds, expertise, and communication styles
- **Specialized Knowledge**: Domain-specific insights and decision-making frameworks
- **Contextual Memory**: Ability to remember previous conversations and build relationships
- **Collaborative Intelligence**: Advisors can reference each other and build on conversations

### Key Differentiators
1. **Multi-Advisor Architecture**: Switch between advisors seamlessly within conversations
2. **Persona-Driven AI**: Each advisor has rich personality and expertise profiles
3. **@Mention System**: Natural way to direct questions or switch advisor focus
4. **Conversation Persistence**: All interactions saved and searchable
5. **Tiered Model Access**: Different AI models based on subscription level

## Target Users

## Success Metrics

### User Engagement
- **Daily Active Users**: Target 1000+ within 6 months
- **Session Duration**: Average 15+ minutes per session
- **Conversation Depth**: 10+ messages per conversation
- **Advisor Switching**: 2+ advisors used per session

### Business Metrics
- **Conversion Rate**: 15% free to paid conversion
- **Monthly Recurring Revenue**: $10k+ within 12 months
- **Customer Retention**: 80%+ monthly retention
- **Net Promoter Score**: 50+ NPS

### Technical Metrics
