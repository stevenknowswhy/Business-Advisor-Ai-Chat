# Security and CSS Fixes Applied

## üîí Issue 1: Content Security Policy (CSP) Error - RESOLVED

### Problem
- CSP violation error: "Content Security Policy of your site blocks the use of 'eval' in JavaScript"
- JavaScript execution being blocked by restrictive CSP policies

### Solution Applied
1. **Added comprehensive CSP configuration** in `next.config.js`:
   - Development mode: More permissive CSP with `'unsafe-eval'` for development tools
   - Production mode: Stricter CSP without `'unsafe-eval'` for better security
   - Proper allowlists for Clerk authentication, OpenRouter API, and image sources

2. **Created CSP violation reporting** endpoint at `/api/csp-report`:
   - Logs CSP violations in development for debugging
   - Can be extended to send reports to monitoring services in production

3. **Added security headers**:
   - `X-Frame-Options: DENY`
   - `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`
   - `Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin`
   - `X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block`

### Key CSP Directives
```
default-src 'self'
script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' 'unsafe-eval' (dev) / 'unsafe-inline' (prod)
style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' https://fonts.googleapis.com
img-src 'self' data: https: blob:
connect-src 'self' https://api.clerk.com https://openrouter.ai https://x6amvsxo6a.ufs.sh
```

## üé® Issue 2: CSS @import Rule Positioning - RESOLVED

### Problem
- CSS @import rules not positioned at the top of stylesheets
- Error: "Define @import rules at the top of the stylesheet"

### Solution Applied
1. **Updated `globals.css`**:
   - Moved all @import statements to the very top
   - Added proper comments and organization
   - Added custom styles for better UX (scrollbars, focus states)

2. **Created proper Tailwind configuration**:
   - Added `tailwind.config.ts` with proper content paths
   - Updated PostCSS configuration with autoprefixer

3. **Enhanced CSS structure**:
   - Proper import ordering: @import ‚Üí @theme ‚Üí custom styles
   - Added accessibility improvements (focus styles)
   - Added custom scrollbar styling

## üõ†Ô∏è Additional Improvements

### Performance
- Fixed Turbopack workspace root warning
- Optimized CSS processing with autoprefixer
- Better font loading with proper fallbacks

### Security
- Environment-specific CSP policies
- Comprehensive security headers
- CSP violation monitoring in development

### Developer Experience
- Clear error reporting for CSP violations
- Better CSS organization and comments
- Proper TypeScript configuration for Tailwind

## üß™ Testing the Fixes

### CSP Testing
1. Open browser developer tools
2. Navigate to the application
3. Check Console for CSP violation errors (should be resolved)
4. Verify JavaScript functionality works properly

### CSS Testing
1. Check that all styles load correctly
2. Verify @import statements don't cause warnings
3. Test responsive design and custom styles

## üîÑ Rollback Instructions

If issues arise, you can temporarily disable the CSP by commenting out the `headers()` function in `next.config.js`:

```javascript
// async headers() {
//   // CSP configuration
// },
```

## üìù Notes

- CSP is more permissive in development to allow hot reloading and dev tools
- Production CSP is stricter for better security
- All external domains used by the application are properly allowlisted
- CSS structure follows best practices for maintainability and performance
