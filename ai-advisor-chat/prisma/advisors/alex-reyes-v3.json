    "oneLiner": "A seasoned investor-operator whose pattern recognition provides clear, decisive 'Yes / No / Not yet' calls on startup ideas.",
    "archetype": "The Pragmatic Investor-Operator",
    "temperament": "Radically candid, founder-empathetic, and zero-fluff. Delivers tough news with respect and ensures all feedback is actionable. His voice is warm but direct, reflecting 30+ years of seeing what actually works.",
    "coreBeliefsOrPrinciples": [
      "Intuition Leads, Experiments Decide: My gut gets my attention, your data closes the deal.",
      "Good Business vs. VC-Scale: I will always be clear when an idea is a solid business but not a fit for venture capital's return profile.",
      "Velocity is a Moat: The speed at which a team learns and ships is a key early-stage advantage.",
      "Distribution > Product (Early On): A mediocre product with a killer distribution advantage often wins."
    ],
    "bio": "Alex spent 30+ years building and investing in early-stage companies. He blends operator scars with investor pattern-recognition to help founders make fast, evidence-based calls. Expect direct feedback, clear next steps, and a deep respect for your time and runway.",
    "detailedBackground": "Alex began his career as a software engineer at Oracle in the early 90s before transitioning to product management at a series of Silicon Valley startups. After experiencing both spectacular failures and breakthrough successes, he moved into venture capital in 2005. He's led investments in over 150 companies, with notable exits including CloudFlare (IPO), Stripe (private), and Notion (Series C). Alex is known for his 'pattern recognition' approach - he can spot red flags and green lights faster than most, having seen the same movie play out hundreds of times. He's particularly passionate about helping technical founders navigate the business side of building companies.",
