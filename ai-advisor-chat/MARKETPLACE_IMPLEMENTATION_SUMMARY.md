# Advisor Marketplace - Phase 1 Implementation Summary

## üéØ Overview

Successfully completed **Phase 1: Foundation & Data Model** of the Advisor Marketplace feature implementation. This phase establishes the core backend infrastructure using Convex database system exclusively, replacing the previous sidebar-based advisor selection with a comprehensive marketplace system.

## ‚úÖ Completed Tasks

### 1. **Updated Convex Schema** (`convex/schema.ts`)

- **Enhanced `advisors` table** with marketplace fields:
  - `ownerId`: Optional user ID for private advisors
  - `isPublic`: Boolean flag for marketplace visibility
  - `featured`: Boolean flag for featured marketplace advisors
  - `category`: String categorization (business, marketing, technical, etc.)

- **Added `userAdvisors` junction table** for many-to-many relationships:
  - `userId`: Reference to user who selected the advisor
  - `advisorId`: Reference to selected advisor
  - `selectedAt`: Timestamp of selection
  - `source`: Selection source (manual, team, etc.)
  - `teamId`: Optional reference to team template used

- **Added `teamTemplates` collection** for bulk advisor selection:
  - `id`: Unique string identifier
  - `name`: Display name for the template
  - `description`: Template description
  - `category`: Template category
  - `advisorIds`: Array of advisor references
  - `featured`: Boolean for featured templates
  - `sortOrder`: Display order priority

- **Created comprehensive indexes** for optimal query performance:
  - Advisor indexes: by_category, by_featured, by_owner, by_public, etc.
  - UserAdvisor indexes: by_user, by_advisor, by_user_advisor, etc.
  - TeamTemplate indexes: by_category, by_featured, by_sort_order, etc.

### 2. **Implemented Core Convex Functions** (`convex/marketplace.ts`)

- **`getUserSelectedAdvisors(userId)`**: Query to get user's selected advisors
- **`selectAdvisor(userId, advisorId, source?, teamId?)`**: Mutation to select an advisor
- **`unselectAdvisor(userId, advisorId)`**: Mutation to unselect an advisor
- **`getMarketplaceAdvisors(category?, featured?, limit?)`**: Query public advisors
- **`selectTeam(userId, teamId)`**: Mutation for bulk advisor selection from templates
- **`getTeamTemplates(category?, featured?)`**: Query available team templates
- **`searchMarketplaceAdvisors(searchQuery, category?, limit?)`**: Text search functionality

### 3. **Updated Existing Functions** (`convex/advisors.ts`)

- **Enhanced `createAdvisor` mutation** to support marketplace fields:
  - Added marketplace field parameters
  - Auto-categorization logic based on advisor persona
  - Default values for marketplace visibility

### 4. **Migration & Data Setup** (`convex/migrations.ts`)

- **`setupTeamTemplates()`**: Creates initial team template configurations
- **`setupMarketplaceAdvisors(markAllAsPublic?, featuredAdvisorNames?)`**: Configures existing advisors for marketplace
- **`migrateExistingUsers(dryRun?)`**: Auto-selects existing user advisors for backward compatibility
- **`setupMarketplace(dryRun?)`**: Complete setup orchestration function
