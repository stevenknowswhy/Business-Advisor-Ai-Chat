## üîÑ Current Session Decisions

### 2025-09-18-001
**Status**: `DECIDED`
**Category**: `PROCESS`
**Impact**: `HIGH`
**Decision**: Implement comprehensive task management system before fixing issues
**Context**:
- Critical issues identified (build failure, authentication)
- Need organized approach to systematic completion
- Multiple stakeholders need visibility into progress

**Alternatives**:
1. **Start fixing immediately**:
   - ‚úÖ Fast progress on critical issues
   - ‚ùå No organized tracking
   - ‚ùå Risk of missing dependencies

2. **Create task management first** (CHOSEN):
   - ‚úÖ Clear prioritization and dependencies
   - ‚úÖ Progress tracking for all stakeholders
   - ‚úÖ Better resource allocation
   - ‚ùå Slight delay in starting fixes

**Reasoning**:
- Complex project with multiple dependencies
- Need to maintain focus on critical path
- Documentation helps onboard team members
- Provides framework for future development

**Consequences**:
- Created PROJECT-TODO.md, CHANGELOG.md, DECISION-LOG.md

### 2025-09-18-002
**Status**: `DECIDED`
**Category**: `TECHNICAL`
**Impact**: `CRITICAL`
**Decision**: Fix critical build failure with placeholder implementations rather than removing features
**Context**:
- Build completely blocked due to missing Convex actions and import issues
- Team creation functionality referenced but not fully implemented
- Need to unblock development while preserving future functionality

**Alternatives**:
1. **Remove TeamCreator functionality entirely**:
   - ‚úÖ Quick fix for build
   - ‚ùå Lose feature investment
   - ‚ùå Break existing UI references

2. **Comment out TeamCreator components**:
   - ‚úÖ Temporary build fix
   - ‚ùå Broken user experience
   - ‚ùå Technical debt accumulation

3. **Create placeholder implementations** (CHOSEN):
   - ‚úÖ Build works immediately
   - ‚úÖ Preserves feature structure
   - ‚úÖ Allows incremental improvement
   - ‚ùå Temporary mock data

**Reasoning**:
- Critical path blocked - nothing else works without build
- Team creation is core feature referenced by UI
- Placeholder approach allows progressive enhancement
- Maintains architectural integrity for future implementation

**Consequences**:
- Build now succeeds, enabling other development
- Team creation works with mock data
- Future implementation can replace placeholders incrementally
- No breaking changes to existing UI

**Related Files**:
- `convex/teams.ts` (Created placeholder actions)
- `convex/advisors.ts` (Added placeholder getMany action)
- `src/features/advisors/hooks/useCreateTeam.ts` (Fixed imports)
- Multiple component files with type fixes
