📊 Current Schema Analysis
sequentialthinking_Sequential_thinking
Let me analyze the current Prisma schema to understand the data model complexity and relationships that need to be migrated to Convex. From the codebase retrieval, I can see the current schema has: 1. **User** model: - id (String, primary key) - email, name, image (optional strings) - plan (String, default "free") - timestamps (createdAt, updatedAt) - relationships: conversations[] 2. **Advisor** model: - id (String, primary key) - firstName, lastName, imageUrl (optional strings) - schemaVersion (String) - status (AdvisorStatus enum: active, inactive, archived) - persona, roleDefinition, components, metadata, localization (JSON fields) - modelHint (optional string) - tags (String array) - timestamps - relationships: memories[], conversations[], messages[] 3. **Conversation** model: - id (String, cuid primary key) - userId (String, foreign key to User) - title (optional string) - activeAdvisorId (optional string, foreign key to Advisor) - timestamps - relationships: memories[], activeAdvisor, user, messages[], summaries[] 4. **Message** model: - id (String, cuid primary key) - conversationId (String, foreign key) - sender (MessageSender enum: user, advisor, system) - advisorId (optional string, foreign key) - content (String) - contentJson (optional JSON) - mentions (String array) - tokensUsed (optional Int) - createdAt timestamp - relationships: advisor, conversation (with cascade delete) 5. **AdvisorMemory** model: - Complex model with unique constraints - Relationships to both Advisor and Conversation 6. **ThreadSummary** model (referenced but not fully shown) This is a fairly complex relational schema with multiple foreign keys, JSON fields, enums, and cascade deletes. Convex will handle this differently with its document-based approach and built-in relationships. true 1 5

Now let me analyze the current API routes structure to understand what needs to be migrated to Convex functions: From the directory listing, I can see these API routes: - `/api/advisors` (GET, POST) - CRUD operations for advisors - `/api/advisors/[id]` - Individual advisor operations - `/api/conversations` (GET, POST) - List and create conversations - `/api/conversations/[id]` - Individual conversation operations - `/api/chat` - Chat functionality (likely streaming) - `/api/chat-minimal` - Simplified chat - `/api/messages` - Message operations - `/api/messages/[id]` - Individual message operations - `/api/mentions` - Mention functionality - Various test and debug endpoints The current implementation uses: 1. **requireUser()** function for authentication with Clerk 2. **Prisma client (db)** for database operations 3. **tRPC** for type-safe API calls 4. **Zod schemas** for validation 5. **Next.js API routes** for REST endpoints Key patterns I see: - Authentication middleware using Clerk - Database queries with Prisma including complex joins and relationships - JSON responses with formatted data - Error handling and logging - Mock data fallbacks (currently active due to DB issues) This needs to be translated to: - Convex queries for read operations - Convex mutations for write operations - Convex actions for external API calls - Built-in Convex authentication integration - Real-time subscriptions for chat features true 2 5

Let me think about the migration strategy and potential challenges: **Key Migration Challenges:** 1. **Schema Translation**: Convex uses a different approach than relational databases - No foreign keys, but document references - No complex joins, but can use multiple queries or denormalization - JSON fields translate well to Convex's flexible document structure - Enums need to be handled as string literals with validation 2. **Authentication Integration**: - Current: Clerk → requireUser() → Prisma user sync - Target: Clerk → Convex auth integration → automatic user management - Need to maintain user sync between Clerk and Convex 3. **Real-time Features**: - Current: Polling or manual refresh for chat updates - Target: Convex subscriptions for real-time chat updates - This is actually an improvement over current architecture 4. **API Surface Changes**: - Current: REST API routes with tRPC - Target: Convex functions called directly from frontend - Need to update frontend to use Convex client instead of fetch/tRPC 5. **Data Migration**: - Current PostgreSQL data needs to be exported and imported to Convex - Since current DB is down, we might start fresh or use mock data as seed data - Need to handle ID generation differences (cuid vs Convex IDs) **Migration Advantages:** - Real-time capabilities out of the box - Simplified deployment (no separate database management) - Better TypeScript integration - Automatic scaling - Built-in optimistic updates true 3 5

Now let me plan the specific migration phases in detail: **Phase 1: Analysis & Planning** (Current) - ✅ Analyze current schema and API structure - ✅ Identify migration challenges and opportunities - Create detailed Convex schema design - Plan authentication integration approach - Design real-time features architecture **Phase 2: Convex Setup & Schema** - Install Convex in the monorepo - Configure Convex with provided deployment details - Create schema.ts with all tables (users, advisors, conversations, messages, etc.) - Set up development environment - Test basic Convex operations **Phase 3: Authentication Integration** - Configure Clerk + Convex authentication - Create user management functions - Test authentication flow - Ensure user sync between Clerk and Convex **Phase 4: Core Functions Migration** - Create Convex queries for read operations (getConversations, getAdvisors, etc.) - Create Convex mutations for write operations (createConversation, sendMessage, etc.) - Create Convex actions for external API calls (AI chat integration) - Implement proper error handling and validation **Phase 5: Real-time Features** - Implement real-time subscriptions for chat messages - Add typing indicators - Add online presence features - Test real-time functionality **Phase 6: Frontend Integration** - Replace API calls with Convex client calls - Update components to use Convex hooks - Implement optimistic updates - Add real-time UI updates **Phase 7: Data Migration** - Export existing data (if/when PostgreSQL becomes available) - Transform data format for Convex - Import data to Convex - Validate data integrity **Phase 8: Testing & Validation** - Test all CRUD operations - Test real-time features - Test authentication flows - Performance testing - User acceptance testing **Phase 9: Deployment & Cleanup** - Deploy to production - Remove Prisma dependencies - Remove PostgreSQL configuration - Update documentation - Monitor production performance true 4 5
sequentialthinking_Sequential_thinking
Let me finalize the migration plan with specific technical details and considerations: **Technical Implementation Details:** 1. **Convex Schema Design:** - Users table: Mirror current User model with Convex document structure - Advisors table: Handle JSON fields natively, use string literals for enums - Conversations table: Use Convex document references instead of foreign keys - Messages table: Implement with real-time subscriptions - AdvisorMemory table: Flatten or embed within conversations/advisors as appropriate 2. **Authentication Strategy:** - Use Convex's built-in Clerk integration - Maintain user sync with automatic user creation on first login - Preserve existing user IDs where possible for data continuity 3. **API Migration Strategy:** - Replace REST endpoints with Convex functions - Maintain similar function signatures for easier frontend migration - Use Convex's built-in validation instead of Zod (or integrate Zod with Convex) 4. **Real-time Implementation:** - Use Convex subscriptions for live chat updates - Implement typing indicators with temporary documents - Add presence system for online/offline status 5. **Deployment Configuration:** - Use provided Convex deployment: striped-gnat-509.convex.cloud - Configure environment variables for Convex - Set up CI/CD for Convex functions deployment This migration plan provides a systematic approach to transitioning from PostgreSQL/Prisma to Convex while maintaining all existing functionality and adding real-time capabilities. The current database outage actually makes this an ideal time for the migration since we're already using mock data. false 5 5
