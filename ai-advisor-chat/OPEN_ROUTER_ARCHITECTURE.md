# AI Advisor Chat - Open Router Architecture

## Overview

The AI Advisor Chat is built on **Open Router**, providing model-agnostic AI capabilities with access to multiple state-of-the-art language models. This architecture allows for flexibility, cost optimization, and access to the latest AI models from various providers.

## Core Architecture

### Model Selection Strategy

**Per-Advisor Model Assignment**
- Each advisor can be configured with a specific Open Router model
- Models are selected based on advisor specialty and user requirements
- Fallback mechanisms ensure reliability even if specific models are unavailable

**User Model Selection**
- Users can override advisor default models through a dropdown interface
- Model preferences are saved per user-advisor combination
- Real-time model performance metrics inform user choices

### Open Router Integration

```typescript
// Advisor Model Configuration
interface AdvisorModelConfig {
  defaultModel: string;        // e.g., "anthropic/claude-3-sonnet"
  availableModels: string[];   // Alternative models for this advisor
  specialty: string;           // Advisor specialty area
  optimalFor: string[];        // Tasks this advisor excels at
}

// User Model Selection
interface UserModelPreference {
  userId: string;
  advisorId: string;
  preferredModel: string;
  fallbackModels: string[];
  lastUsed: Date;
}
```

## Model Tier System

### Premium Models (High Performance)
- `anthropic/claude-3-opus` - Best for complex reasoning
- `anthropic/claude-3-sonnet` - Balanced performance and cost
- `openai/gpt-4-turbo` - Latest GPT-4 capabilities

### Base Models (Cost-Effective)
- `anthropic/claude-3-haiku` - Fast responses, good quality
- `openai/gpt-3.5-turbo` - Reliable and cost-effective
- `meta/llama-2-70b-chat` - Open-source alternative

### Specialized Models
- `google/gemini-pro` - Multilingual capabilities
- `mistral/mistral-large` - European language focus
- `perplexity/pplx-70b-online` - Real-time information access

## Implementation Features

### 1. Intelligent Model Routing
```typescript
class ModelRouter {
  async selectOptimalModel(request: ChatRequest, advisor: Advisor): Promise<ModelSelection> {
    // Consider:
    // - Advisor's configured default model
    // - User's saved preferences
    // - Real-time model availability
    // - Cost optimization
    // - Performance requirements
  }
}
```

### 2. User Model Selection UI
- Dropdown in chat interface showing available models
- Model performance indicators (response time, cost)
- Favorite models quick selection
- Model comparison features

### 3. Performance Monitoring
```typescript
interface ModelPerformance {
  model: string;
  responseTime: number;
  cost: number;
  userSatisfaction: number;
  reliability: number;
  lastUsed: Date;
}
```

### 4. Cost Optimization
- Automatic model selection based on complexity
- User-defined spending limits
- Model cost comparison tools
- Usage analytics and reporting
